# ACEFLIX PRESENTATION

First of all, ACEFLIX is a website that offers a wide range of trailers (moovies & series).

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use platform with thoughtfully designed navigation, tailored specifically for the user, allowing them to find content quickly.

This project was developed using the following stack: HTML / CSS / React.
We also used an API that gives us access to a large selection of content (series and movies).

We had 4 weeks to complete this project, and we were able to apply Agile methodology, which allowed us to be flexible and adjust requirements based on the project's progress.

If you need to use this repository, here are the steps to follow:

📁 First, you need to clone the project into your personal repository.

🎬 Next, you need to create an account on the TMDB website to get access to the API. Here is the link: https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=fr

💻 Now you can open the project in your IDE and run the following command: npm install

🔓 Then, create a .env file (in the client folder) based on the .env.sample file (you will need to specify your API key previously created on the TMDB website).

🎉 You can now run the command npm run dev.
